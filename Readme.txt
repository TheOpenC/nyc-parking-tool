NYC-parking-tool uses the NYC DOT parking api + National Weather Service to send reminders to move my car on parking days and update me on the weather. It also factors in the 'suspended days calendar' that accounts for religious and government holidays and unique circumstances such as natural disasters or god-forbid a terrorist attack. I'd love to add GIS location and push notifications over time.
