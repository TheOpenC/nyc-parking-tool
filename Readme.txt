NYC-parking-tool uses the NYC DOT parking API, National Weather Service API, and NYC critical news API to send reminders to move my car on parking days, update me on the weather and send me a brief summary of any breaking news daily to my phone and email. It also factors in the 'suspended days calendar' that accounts for religious and government holidays and unique circumstances such as natural disasters or god-forbid a terrorist attack. I'd love to add GIS location and push notifications over time.
