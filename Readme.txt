"Dude, where's my car" uses the NYC DOT parking api + google maps to send reminders to move my car on parking days. It also factors in the 'suspended days calendar' that accounts for religious and government holidays and unique circumstances such as natural disasters or god-forbid a terrorist attack. I'd love to add GIS location and push notifications too over time.

Parking regulations for a given street

The site should play the dude where's my car soundtrack if the user chooses to do so.
The site should also find a representative photo of the user's car in a carmax generic way profile view with the background cut out. 
Sends the user a 1 day prior and same day notification -- either move your car or parking is suspended. 
    Future features could recommend which side of the street to park on for max parking value.
